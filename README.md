### Adding Context
Added context to original dataset was done with OpenAI chatgpt-3.5.
We use the following prompt:

`
Please provide a context to the given phrase, insert it into a long sentence, place it as part of the larger sentence and use the phrase verbatim. The sentence should also start with the letter <letter> the phrase is: <phrase>"}`


Where `<phrase>}` is replaced by the appropriate phrase from the dataset and `<letter>` is uniformly sampled from A-Z to increase diversity.
A subset of this data was validated by a human annotator to make sure similarity measures still hold.


#### This dataset is used for a research paper currently under review. We ask that any usage of it awaits the publication of the paper and an appropriate open-source license that will be added at a later time.
